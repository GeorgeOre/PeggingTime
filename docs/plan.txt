When starting a game development project, especially with a 
custom physics engine and a tight timeline, it's important 
to prioritize tasks that establish the core functionality 
and allow for iterative development. 

Here's a recommended implementation order:

Week 1: Core Infrastructure and Basic Functionality
Set Up Project Structure:
    Create the directory structure and add the basic files 
    (README.md, LICENSE, .gitignore, Makefile).
Basic Physics Engine:
    Implement the core physics engine (physics.c, physics.h).
    Include basic physics features such as gravity and collision 
    detection.
Player Controls:
    Implement basic player controls using the keyboard 
    (controls.c, controls.h).
    Ensure the player can move and perform basic actions like 
    shooting projectiles.
Rendering:
    Set up a simple rendering system to display sprites on 
    the screen (rendering.c, rendering.h).
    Implement basic text rendering for debugging and UI elements.
Game Loop:
    Create the main game loop to handle game state updates, 
    physics updates, and rendering (main.c).

Week 2: Core Gameplay and AI
Game Logic:
    Implement the core game logic for single-player and 
    multiplayer modes (game.c, game.h).
    Develop the basic mechanics of the roguelike adventure and 
    versus modes.
AI Development:
    Implement basic AI for enemies (ai.c, ai.h).
    Ensure that the AI can interact with the physics engine 
    and player.
Level Design and Progression:
    Create a system for generating and managing levels 
    (levels.c, levels.h).
    Develop a level tree for the roguelike adventure mode.
Power-ups and Items:
    Implement the power-up selection process and integrate it 
    with the game mechanics.
    Develop basic items and power-ups that affect gameplay.

Week 3: Additional Features and Polish
Multiplayer Mode:
    Develop the networked/multiplayer functionality if it 
    hasn't been fully implemented yet.
    Test and debug the multiplayer interactions.
Enhancements and Additional Features:
    Implement any remaining features, such as 2D parallax 
    effects, sound effects, music, and animations.
    Add any optional but cool features if time permits.
Polish and Optimization:
    Optimize the physics engine and game performance.
    Polish the user interface and overall game presentation.
Testing and Debugging:
    Conduct thorough testing of all features and game modes.
    Fix any bugs and ensure the game is stable.
Documentation:
    Update the README.md with detailed instructions and documentation.
    Ensure that the code is well-documented and maintainable.
